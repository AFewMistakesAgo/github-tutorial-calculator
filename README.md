# Github Tutorial Calculator

This repository is to act as an example open source project to help individuals become familiar with `git` and `Github`.

The two important files are:

`calculator.py` - This file acts as the code base that would exist for an open source project. In this tutorial, the code base is a simple calculator class written in Python3. The supported operations are:

* addition
* subtraction
* multiplication
* division

This script isn't executable on its own, as it simply defines the above four methods.

`test.py` - This file acts as the unit test that would exist for an open source project. In this tutorial, the unit tests have an example of passing (1, 1), (1, 0) and (1, -1) to each function listed above. To execute the test suite, run:

    $ python3 test.py


## Git

Git is a piece of version control software (vcs). What that means is it tracks the state of the project, keeping track of all files and their changes throughout history. Git is incredibly popular and most software engineer roles expect you to be familiar with it and working as a data scientist is no different.

Using git efficiently can save you countess hours and is an incredibly convenient way to ensure you code is secure and in more than one place.

Git is free and open source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.


## Github

Github is a web based remote hosting service for Git. Essentially, Github is a for profit company that provides a service which provides many free tier tools for developers and enterprise level plans for businesses.

When working on a project, you should be using Git 

Its important to note there are many competitors to Github, like Gitlab, which are similar. Its good to lookup the differences between sites like these. Often their free tiers differ considerably.
